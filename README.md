# DarkScraper v6.0 - Advanced Dark Web Resource Discovery Engine
================================================================

DarkScraper is a cutting-edge, Tor-powered reconnaissance tool designed for systematic discovery and cataloging of hidden services on the dark web.

Powered by a sophisticated architecture, DarkScraper combines:
- Tor-based anonymous crawling with automatic circuit rebuilding
- Machine-learning inspired resource classification
- Multi-threaded exploration with depth-controlled crawling
- Real-time resource monitoring and adaptive throttling
- Comprehensive metadata extraction and relationship mapping

Advanced Operational Guide:
──────────────────────────

Discovery Workflow:
1. Seed Generation:
   - Query multiple dark web search engines
   - Extract 150-300 seed URLs per keyword
   - Prioritize .onion domains and known resources

2. Depth-based Crawling:
   - Level 0: Seed URLs (direct search results)
   - Level 1: Discovered links from seed pages
   - Level 2: Links from promising resources
   - Level 3+: Specialized exploration of high-value targets

3. Resource Processing:
   - Content type detection
   - Metadata extraction
   - Relationship mapping
   - Classification and scoring

4. Continuous Enrichment:
   - New search engines added automatically
   - Priority URLs receive deeper analysis
   - Resource cross-linking between keywords

Performance Tuning:
- Increase --max-concurrent for high-bandwidth connections
- Adjust --delay-min/--delay-max for target responsiveness
- Lower --low-threshold for resource-constrained systems
- Use --merge-keywords for broad-scope investigations

Security Protocols:
- Tor circuit renewal every 25 requests (default)
- Strict .onion domain validation
- No JavaScript execution
- Automatic cleartext avoidance
- Zero persistent cookies

Output Analysis Tools:
1. Resource Explorer:
   jq '. | select(.type == "forum")' resources/*.json
   - Filter resources by type

2. Relationship Mapper:
   jq '.metadata.internal_links' resources/*.json | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr
   - Identify frequently linked resources

3. Timeline Analysis:
   jq '.discovered' resources/*.json | sort
   - Track discovery chronology

4. Content Analysis:
   jq -r 'select(.content_length > 10000) | .url' resources/*.json
   - Find large resources
